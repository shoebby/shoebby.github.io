            <h3>Pen Plotters, Fractals, and Other Whimsical Tangents</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>
                    For my current master's I've been fucking around with these nifty older machines called 'pen Plotters'. In essence, these machines draw based on
                    given instructions sent over a COM port. It is janky, imperfect, surprisingly precise, and I absolutely love it.
                </p>

                    <p style="margin: 0;">
                        One of the first results from experimenting with this hardware were these things called lenses; a number of increasingly small/large circles
                        with variance in how filled in they are. They are visually appealing (to me atleast) and might make for a cool tattoo someday I think, as
                        have a surprising number of people also said.
                        <br><Br>
                        Here I found that the results from a pen plotter arent quite digital and not quite analog, but an interesting inbetween. It's clearly drawn,
                        you can see where the pen is picked up and placed down and it bleeds in a very hand-written sort of way, but it is mechanically precise like 
                        how a modern printer would be!
                        <br><br>
                        I saw a lot of potential in this for making interesting graphics, textures, whatever honestly. and so I set out to mess around with it more,
                        especially with writing python scripts that help generate the instructions necessary to make things like these efficiently, and also, 
                        semi-randomly generated.
