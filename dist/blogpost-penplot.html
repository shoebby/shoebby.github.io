            <h3>Pen Plotters, Fractals, and Other Whimsical Tangents</h3>
            <div class="box">
                <p>
                    For my current master's I've been fucking around with these nifty older machines called 'pen Plotters'. In essence, these machines draw based on
                    given instructions sent over a COM port. It is janky, imperfect, surprisingly precise, and I absolutely love it.
                </p>

                    <p style="margin: 0;">
                        One of the first results from experimenting with this hardware were these things called lenses; a number of increasingly small/large circles
                        with variance in how filled in they are. They are visually appealing (to me atleast) and might make for a cool tattoo someday I think, as
                        have a surprising number of people also said.
                        <br><Br>
                        Here I found that the results from a pen plotter arent quite digital and not quite analog, but an interesting inbetween. It's clearly drawn,
                        you can see where the pen is picked up and placed down and it bleeds in a very hand-written sort of way, but it is mechanically precise like 
                        how a modern printer would be!
                        <br><br>
                        I saw a lot of potential in this for making interesting graphics, textures, whatever honestly. and so I set out to mess around with it more,
                        especially with writing python scripts that help generate the instructions necessary to make things like these efficiently, and also, 
                        semi-randomly generated.

                        Side tangent: fractals! they are very cool, and using Python it's possible to generate a set of instructions for a pen plotter to draw them!
                        You simply specify the start and end point of the first branch and go from there, creating in this case a binary tree fractal, much like the
                        one you can see on the right here >>>>.
                        <br><br>
                        But what if you introduce
                        <span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #ef5350, #f48fb1, #7e57c2, #2196f3, #26c6da, #43a047, #eeff41,
                        #f9a825, #ff5722); background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">randomness</span>?
                        <br><br>
                        Well then you have a lot of variables you can mess with, for example what if you randomize the branch angle between two set thresholds,
                        and do the same with the ratio? Turns out you end up with very organic-looking tree structures! Example below vvvvvv.

                        These explorations made me interested in generative art, not the evil swimming pool-evaporating kind, but the tuneable kind, which I can
                        hopefully do more with in my coming project(s)! First up has been a browser extension called
                        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webby-sprouts/">Webby Sprouts</a>, which takes the open webpage's DOM and turns it
                        into a tree fractal; visualizing the bones of a website.
                        <br><br>
                        Turns out: a lot of websites have a sort of finger print, their DOM is visually distinct to a certain extent! The Facebook Fan, Bluesky
                        Reed, Itch Twins, it's cool poster material, and it can become a fun toy in and of itself I think.
                        <br><br>
                        And yes, every single branch is an individual div, rotated and sized based on its parent div, so in the DOM it's also a fractal in a dropdown
                        kind of way, fucking SUE me Jana!!!!!!
                        <br><br>
                        So what now? I'm going to finish up the Weeby Sprouts browser extension to make it more customizeable, more fun, more playful! After that
                        who knows, maybe do this stuff in 3D?
